# Stepper Mottors

High Precision: Instead of rotating at a constant speed, stepper motors move in discreet steps.

Fully programmable: speed, direction, and position.

Can hold position while powered.

Widely use in 3D printers.

- **Unipolar Stepper Motor 5V**:

    - See [reference image]
      
    - Small, low-power motor suitable for lightweight mechanisms.
    
    - Requires a motor driver (example, ULN2003).
    
    - Requires external power supply (cannot be powered by the Arduino board).
  
- **Bipolar Stepper motor 12V (large and small)**: More powerful than a 5V motor, providing higher torque (useful for heavier loads). Requires a motor driver

## Stepper Motor

Stepper motors require a controller to apply voltage to the motor in steps. 

**Important safety note**

Motors draw more current than LEDs or sensors.

- Always check that your power supply can provide enough current for the motor you are using.

- USB ports and Arduino pins cannot power motors directly.

- Using an unsuitable power source can cause overheating, unexpected resets, or damage to components.
